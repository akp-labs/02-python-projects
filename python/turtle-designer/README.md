# Turtle Designer

A Python project that demonstrates **repetitive motion patterns**, **time-controlled animation**, and **keyboard-based interruption** using the `turtle`, `time`, and `keyboard` modules.

This project explores how deterministic motion loops behave — and how humans regain control.

## 🧠 What This Program Does

- Draws a predefined geometric motion pattern using turtle graphics
- Repeats the pattern a fixed number of times initially
- Continues running **indefinitely** until a specific key is pressed
- Uses real-time keyboard input to break execution

This is a simple but powerful example of:
- Loop control
- Function reuse
- Blocking vs interrupt-driven behavior

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `keyboard` library  
- Works best on Windows (keyboard hooks require elevated privileges on some systems)

Install dependency:
```bash
pip install keyboard
